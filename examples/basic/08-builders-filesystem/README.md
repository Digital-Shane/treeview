# Builders Filesystem

This example demonstrates using the NewTreeFromFileSystem constructor to create tree views from filesystem paths with various
configuration options. It shows how to build trees from current directory, home directory, and parent directory paths
with configurable depth limits and filtering, handle special path characters and resolution for paths (`.`, `..`, and `~`),
and apply filesystem-specific formatting with file type icons and directory structure visualization
using the built-in provider.

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```
