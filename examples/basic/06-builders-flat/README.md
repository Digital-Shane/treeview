# Flat Builder Demo

This example demonstrates how to transform flat data structures into hierarchical trees
using parent-ID relationships. It shows you how the flat builder can automatically construct
a tree from records that reference their parent nodes and apply conditional expansion to
specific nodes. This approach is perfect when your data comes from databases or APIs that
return flat lists rather than nested structures.

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```
