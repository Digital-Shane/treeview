# Workflow Visualization

This example demonstrates how to create custom tree nodes with custom data using a workflow 
visualization. It shows how to represent multistep processes with nested sub-workflows, use custom
formatters to display duration and progress indicators, and apply status-based color coding to
visualize workflow progression through different phases.

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```
