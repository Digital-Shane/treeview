# Basic Simple Tree

This example demonstrates the fundamental tree creation and rendering capabilities of the TreeView library. It shows how to create a basic hierarchical tree structure with a root node, child nodes, and grandchild nodes, then render the tree in two different states: fully expanded, and partially expanded with focus highlighting moved.

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```
